# Self Driving Car using JavaScript and Neural Networks


This is a neural network that has been created using JavaScript with no libraries. Neural network has been demonstrated through a self-driving car simulation by implementing every component step-by-step.

Components of this project are:
1. Car Driving Mechanics
2. Environment definition
3. Sensor Simulation
4. Collision Detection
5. Control car using neural network

This project gave me a deeper insight into how neural networks work, the mathematics behind them, car driving physics and tested my vanilla javascript implementation skills through interactive animation.
